# Text-To-Speech

Considering the `requirements.txt`, all the libraries should be downloaded through the [install.sh](https://github.com/Aborevsky01/Text-To-Speech/blob/main/install.sh) file. If any concers/issues appear, please contact me for the decision.

The entire training dataset should start being created just when you run [train.py](https://github.com/Aborevsky01/Text-To-Speech/blob/main/train.py). However, if any issues arise, you can also write me to find a solution.
